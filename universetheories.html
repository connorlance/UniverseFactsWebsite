	<p>Donut Theory:</p>
	<p>The donut theory is that the universe is shaped like a donut. This theory is based on the assumption that the universe is self contained, and that there is nothing outside of the universe. It is also based on data that supports the universe being mostly flat. The surface of the donut represents the universe. The universe is so flat that you would never notice the curvature of the donut's surface. If you travel straight on the short side of the donut, you will reach your same poistion and never meet an edge. If you travel straight on the long outside or the short inside of the donut, you will reach the same position and never meet an edge. </p>

	<p>"Forever Expanding Theory:</p>
	<p>I could not find a name for this theory so I came up with the name. The universe is expanding and that rate of expansion is accelerating. If the expansion never stops, then eventually all matter will be so far apart that near nothingness exists. If the universe is forever expanding in every direction, then no matter where you are in the universe you could never find a center because it expands in every direction. There could be 2 ends to this theory. 1. The universe ends in near nothingness and exists like that infinitly. 2. The universe expands so far apart that the near nothingness causes another Big Bang and the cycle repeats itself.  </p>
